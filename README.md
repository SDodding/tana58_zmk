## Tana 58 Firmware

Builds the default configuration and keymap for the [Tana58](https://github.com/SDodding/tana58) keyboard.

To flash to each half hit the reset button twice and drop the appropriate half firmware file onto the keyboard drive.

I'd reccomend flashing this firmware to the Nice!Nano / NN compatible controller before assembling the board so that you can access the pins to force a reset if required.
